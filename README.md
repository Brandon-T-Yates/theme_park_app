# theme_park_app

A new Flutter project that is inspired by the Universal Studios app, 
developed with the idea of being a sort of blog for rides and theme parks.

This is a small project just to get myself familiar with Flutter. 

I have no plans on launching this app nor do I own any of the assets used in this app. 

All rights go to their respected owners and companies.
